Here are the steps I came up with to breakdown the night writer project:

*1. Open the text file (FileOpen)
*2. Read the text file (FileReader)

3. Turn plain text into Braille text
   *a. Create a hash of letters (done)
   *b. For each plain text letter, write braille letter on three lines (partially done)
   *c. Support capitalization (done)
   d. Support numbers (yet to be )
   *e. Constrain braille file to 80 characters wide

*4. Write braille text in new text file

*5. Write test files, TDD

Steps:
*1. Turn one letter into 2x3 braille letter
*2. Turn two letters into braille letters
*3. Turn many letters into braille letters
*4. Make a capitalized letter
*5. Support 80 character length
6. Turn braille letters into plain letters
   *a. Read braille file
   *b. Change single string into three strings of braille by separating at the new lines
   *c. Slice! off the first two characters from each string and join into a single string of 6 characters
   *d. Get the corresponding letter using the inverted map
   *e. Make a new string of plain letters
   *f. Output plain letters to the message text file
   *g. Account for capital letters
   *h. Fix output message character length
   *i. Account for messages > 80 characters
7. Support numbers
8. Support contractions
9. Support new lines
